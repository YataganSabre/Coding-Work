print("This program will find you the kinetic energy of a object given its mass and velocity")  # States purpose
print()  # Creates space
m = float(input("What is the objects mass?"))  # prompts for m
v = float(input("What is the objects velocity?"))  # prompts for v
kj = (.5*m)*(v**2)  # solves
print()
print("The kinetic energy in joules is: ", kj)  # displays answer
