print("This program will find millimeters of mercury given X number of pascals.")  # Tells user what the program does.
print()  # Creates a space
p = float(input("As such, how many pascals do you have?"))  # Prompts user input in float form.
print("-------------------------------------------------------------------")  # Seperates inputs from actual answer
mm = p/133.322  # Preforms calculations
print(p, "Pascal(s) is equal to:", mm, "Millimeters of Mercury.")  # Tells user the answer
